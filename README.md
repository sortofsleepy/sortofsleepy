I'm a frontend-dev / creative technologist in the Bay Area. 

I have been a part of teams that have worked with a wide range of clients, from start-ups to large companies, such as Google, Facebook, Snap, and Nike, creating websites, mobile applications, interactive exhibits, and AR effects.

My core competencies include front-end web engineering primarily with custom software with vanilla JavaScript/Typescript. I also have some experience with frameworks such as Svelte, React and Vue, along with other tools such as Three.js, Cinder, and openFrameworks. Lately I've been using [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) and Vulkan for personal work. 

I'm always on the lookout for interesting work that pushes the boundaries of what's possible and allows me to grow and add value as a developer.

I'm actually not really using Github anymore outside of situations where a company I'm working with is using Github or I happen to come across an interesting repo. Find me on Gitlab under the same username as well as the username `xoio`.
